Here is a collection thermal data analysis code I've made over the years in a professional setting. 

Most of this code won't work without the exact dataset, but these serve as examples to showcase my coding style. Some of it may be written at haste, as aggressive timelines usually got in the way of making pretty code. 

Enjoy!
